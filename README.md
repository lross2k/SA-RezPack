# SA-RezPack
This collection includes multiple mods inteded to be easy to install to any vanilla GTA SA 
game folder for versions 1.0 or Steam, many fixes and quality of life improvements, as well
as dynamic lighting thanks to [gtaRenderHook](https://github.com/petrgeorgievsky/gtaRenderHook).

## Installation
***I recommend using a clean install of GTA SA*** to use this pack, however it should be possible 
to install it to already modded games, but some problems might come up; **Not tested for the**
**Rockstar Games Launcher version**.

1. Download the release file.
2. Make a backup of your Grand Theft Auto San Andreas folder (*recommended*).
3. Unzip it to the game folder.
4. Launch `gta-sa.exe` or your preferred launcher.

## Why a github repo?
Well, I would like to make this a smart installed, but that's for the future and just for 
learning purposes.

*Also the formatting would be prettier this way.*
