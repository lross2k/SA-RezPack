# SA-RezPack
This collection includes multiple mods inteded to be easy to install to any vanilla GTA SA 
game folder for versions 1.0 or Steam, many fixes and quality of life improvements, as well
as dynamic lighting thanks to [gtaRenderHook](https://github.com/petrgeorgievsky/gtaRenderHook).

## Installation
***I recommend using a clean install of GTA SA*** to use this pack, however it should be 
possible to install it to already modded games, but some problems might come up.

0. Make a backup of your Grand Theft Auto San Andreas folder (*recommended*).
### If you have no mods installed at all
1. [Downgrade](https://gtaforums.com/topic/927016-san-andreas-downgrader/) your game to 1.0 
version if needed (Steam, Rockstar Games Launcher) and remeber to rename the generated 
`gta_sa.exe` as `gta-sa.exe` replacing the original one.
2. Install Silent's ASI Loader or Ultimate ASI Loader [**Needed for Rockstar Launcher**] 
(***all mods are linked below***).
3. Unpack the Mod Loader into the root folder (where `gta-sa.exe` is located).
### General fixes (no dx11 shaders)
4. Dowload the mods you want from the list and drop them into their corresponding modloader 
folder, ***look for special cases with the symbol*** \*
  - SkyUI needs GInput to be installed
  - CLEO must be installed in the root folder
  - RenderHook must be installed in the root folder
  - ReShade has to be installed following their installer
5. After installing all the mods you want, dowload the [latest release](https://github.com/RezmiCR/SA-RezPack/releases) 
of my presets, and drop the folder content into your game folder, just check for the mods you 
care about inside of the `modloader/` folder.

## Mods

## Why a github repo?
Well, I'd like to make this a smart installer, but that's for the future and just for 
learning purposes.

*Also the formatting would be prettier this way.*
